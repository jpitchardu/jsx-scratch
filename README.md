A JSX Transpiler, just for fun!

## Reasoning

Well, I was bored and a JSX Renderer seemed like an easy enough project for a monday's afternoon.

- [ ] Error handling (Either throw exceptions or return an unsuccessful rendering object)

## Example

There is a full working, yet basic, example [here](https://codepen.io/jpichardo/pen/yqXbeq?editors=0010#0)
